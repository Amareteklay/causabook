## What this is

This is a living, opinionated set of notes on modern causal inference—written to be **used**, not merely read.
It’s meant for researchers and practitioners who want to move from:
**question → design → identification → estimation → robustness → communication**.

## Who it’s for

- **Applied researchers** who want a reliable workflow and mental models.
- **Economists, data scientists, policy analysts** doing observational or experimental work.
- Anyone who wants to build intuition for *when* a method works and *why* it fails.

## How to use the book

1. Start with **Foundations** to build shared language: potential outcomes, DAGs, identification.
2. Jump to **Methods** when you have a concrete design in mind (DiD, IV, matching, synthetic control, etc.).
3. Use **Checklists & templates** when writing: assumptions, threats, diagnostics, sensitivity.

:::callout-tip
If you’re reading this to solve a specific problem, begin with your *estimand*:
**What effect, on what population, under what intervention, compared to what alternative?**
:::

## What you’ll get out of it

- A clean way to translate real questions into **estimands**
- Repeatable **workflows** for common designs
- Practical guidance on **assumption checks**, diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses
- Notes on pitfalls: post-treatment bias, bad controls, selection, interference, measurement issues

## Roadmap

This book evolves. The near-term build plan:

- Foundations: counterfactuals, DAGs, adjustment, SUTVA/interference, measurement
- Core designs: randomized experiments, DiD, IV, RD, matching, synthetic controls
- Modern tools: doubly robust estimation, causal ML (CATE/HTE), mediation (carefully), sensitivity
- Practice: reporting templates, robustness checklists, “what can go wrong” library

## Contributing and reuse

If you find an issue or want to contribute:
- Suggest edits via the repo (issues/PRs), or share a short write-up and I’ll integrate it.
- Contributions should favor **clarity**, **assumption discipline**, and **reproducible examples**.

:::callout-note
This is a living document. Expect iterative improvements and occasional restructuring.

## About Causalica

Causalica is a small, focused effort to build:
- trustworthy learning resources (this book),
- practical tooling (checklists, templates, automation),
- and “Amare-in-the-loop” workflows for applied causal analysis.
